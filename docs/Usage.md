# Usage

The library can be used one of two ways, either as individual object-oriented 
classes which require the EtClient to act as a mediator with the ExactTarget 
servers or treating the EtClient as a factory which allows you to ask for 
classes at which point the EtClient class will still act as the intercessor 
to the server.
